- NEVER THROW EXCEPTIONS!!!!!! Always return a result type for methods that could fail. Anything that can fail is wrapped in a try/catch
- You are building a code generation. Don't generate code yourself that is the responsibility of the generator
- AVOID DUPLICATION. Always check for the existence of types, methods and variables before creating them
- No interfaces! Use Action<T> or Func<T> for abstractions
- AVOID ASSIGNMENTS!!!! Use EXPRESSIONS where possible 
- NO CONSECUTIVE Console.WriteLine calls. Use string interpolation on a sinle line
- DO NOT USE GIT - Unless explicitly requested
- Static extension methods on IDbConnection and ITransaction only! No classes for getting data
- NO CLASSES. Records and Static Methods!!! - FP style code wherever with pure static methods
- Never make consecutive Console.WriteLine calls. Use string interpolation
- Turn all warnings up to ERRORS and include as many Roslyn analyzer rules as possible, especially for null safety
- Never use Fluent Assertions
- Keep files under 450 LOC
- Run dotnet csharpier . on the root folder of the repo every now and then
- No placeholders! If you don't have time to implement something properly, leave a LOUD compilation error with a TODO instead
- One type per file, except for small Records
- Break types up into folders and use the correct namespace for the folder
- All public members MUST have XMLDOC documentation, except on tests
- DON'T use Regex! Parse the SQL with the official Antlr .g4 or a well tested existing parsing library
- Use a build props for everything and remove duplicate config from the csproj, especially Roslyn/code rule config. 
- Do not comment code out. DELETE IT.
- Keep methods small
- Keep the readme updated
- Don't put temp files or anything in the root folder
